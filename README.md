  Objective
</h2>

The aim of this project is to select and manipulate different algorithms so it will be possible to sort a stack using limited number of movements.

It will be passed to the program, by argument, the integers that will be sorted. This integers are going to be inserted in a Stack.

To sort it, the student may only use an auxiliary stack and some of given functions that will make a determinated movement.

Using this movements, the program as to sort the stack in the minimum number of movements possible.
